# Differential Gaussian Rasterization with Depth Forward and Backward Functionality

An extension of the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". 

**We make two contributions: Depth forward and backward. We have verified its correctness on real datasets.**
